# Going through cookiecutter

## Welcome

- This class is about how to organise your research projects
- One of these things that seems trivial at first, but quickly becomes complicated
- Two things to it:
  - How to organise the files on disk
  - How to run the workflow
- Repetitive, did not want to reinvent the wheel each time, you should not need to, either
- Over the years, created a set of templates to start from with the help of former students

## Four steps

1. In this screencast, will go through the process of getting the template configured for your machine
2. Then you will do that on your own.
3. Will explain how files are organised
4. Will explain tool for workflow organisation (pytask)
