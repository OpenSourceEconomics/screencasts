3. basic example
   - Ideal task: loading, 1 function call, saving
   - Mention this again wherever useful
4. reusing variables in a project
   - start with example just show how bld and algos are passed around
   - explain that benefit of log is immediate persistence
5. multiple dependencies or targets
   - boiled down version of example just using algos[0], no loop
6. Parametrization / repeated tasks
   - full example
7. Debugging
   - Explain that this is repeating the example from 5 but doing something wrong
   - Very common mistake: Keep using produces without keys even though you switched from
     single product to multiple products
