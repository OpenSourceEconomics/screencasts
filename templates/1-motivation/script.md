# Going through cookiecutter

## Welcome

- This sequence is about organising your research projects
- One of these things that seems trivial at first, but quickly becomes complicated
- Two things to it:
  - How to organise the files on disk
  - How to run the workflow
- Repetitive, did not want to reinvent the wheel each time, you should not need to, either
- Over the years, created a set of templates to start from with the help of former and current students

## Four screencasts

1. This screencast: Rationale, background
2. Mechanics of going through the process of getting the template configured for your
   machine
3. What happens when you run the example workflow (using pytask, entire series of )
4. Will explain how files are organised

Ideally, you will try things out on your own.
